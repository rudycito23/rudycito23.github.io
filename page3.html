            After a stellar, hall of fame career in the big leagues, Tony Gwynn decided to take over the baseball program at his alma mater, San Diego State University, where I had the opportunity to call him, Coach Gwynn. Coach Gwynn would go on to coach the Aztecs for 12 seasons. It could have been longer had it not been for his untimely death in 2014; he died of complications after a long fight with cancer. He is survived by his wife and two children.
